# Food Ordering Website
I developed a mini project on Frontend for a food ordering system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It's a simple website for food orders that calculates the total bill for each customer

This dining establishment goes by the name of "Anna's Uta Mane," which translates to Anna's Eating House, and specializes in dishes from South India.
